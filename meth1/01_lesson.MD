## Lesson objective: Intro to data structures - Arrays

### Aim: To declare and initialize arrays and locate and modify elements within them.

### background knowledge
- data types
- variables (declaring, initializing)
- mathematic operators

### Warm up
time: 5-8 minutes<br>
Have 3 small receptacles (hats, buckets etc)<br>

Explain each receptacles represents a variable where we will store an int value<br>
Scenario: I want to write some type of program to store test grades<br>
Right now, each grade will be stored in a variable<br>
Choose 3 students to pick 3 different numbers. Write number on sheet of paper. put paper in receptacle<br>

Q - lets say I have 20 kids in the class. What is a problem with this method?<br>
Allow 30-60 turn & talk. Get responses. - Will need a lot of variables<br>

Take one receptacle. "What if I could store all my test scores in one variable?"<br>
Have students write down number and all put paper in the same receptacle.<br>
Verbally make note of the order in who put their paper in the receptacle.<br>

Q - "what could be an issue if I want to find a specific grade in this variable?"
60 sec Turn & talk. Get responses<br>
Possible responses: You wont be able to locate it. You dont know where it is.<br>

Draw attention to the fact that you were making note of the order they were put in.<br>
If we keep track of this, it could help us locate each value in this variable.<br>

### Lesson Content
time: 8-10 minutes<br>
**Introduction to Array**<br>
Start by front loading basic information about how to declare and initialize an array and array elements<br>
Provide specific code syntax for each example<br>
**important information**<br>
- declare (using square brackets)
- must include same type of primitives
- Initializing array size
- Index locations
- How to assign value to an array (during vs after initialization)
- array length

### Lesson Activity
time: 15 minutes<br>
Unplugged activity: Have 6-10 students stand up at the front of the classroom<br>
Provide each student with a 8x11 sheet of paper with an integer written on in<br>
Have the students stand in a line going from left to right, each holding up their number<br>
Inform the class that this line of students represents an array.<br>

Prompt the rest of the class with questions about this array.<br>
For some responses, students can come up to whiteboard and write down what code would look like<br>
**possible questions**<br>
How could we initialize this array?<br>
Ask to locate certain values by index<br>
Ask what is the index of certain values<br>

Ask students to write code for assigning new value to certain indices.<br>
Student who correctly does this can take that spot in the line<br>

Start posing question involving mathematic operations on different elements<br>
- a[4] = a[3] + 5;
- a[0] = a[5] - a[3];
- a[1] += 10;

### Assessment
time: 5 minutes
Provide with multiple question exit slip<br>
**possible questions**<br>
Example array: <br>
a = [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 ,80, 90, 100]<br>
What is at index 6 of this array?<br>
What is the index of 50 in this array?<br>
How would you change the element 70 to 75 in this array<br>
What is the length of this array?<br>

Because of the short answer type questions that can be asked about arrays,<br>
After a more formal individualized assessment, plan a kahoot to reinforce these concepts if time allows<br>
