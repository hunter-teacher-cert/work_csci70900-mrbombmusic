# Final Project - Portfolio Lesson Plans
## Methods for Teaching Computer Science I

Topic: Introduction to classes and objects.<br>
Intended student audience: 7/8th grade<br>
Programming Language: p5.js<br>
Background Knowledge: Variables, Conditional statements, loops, functions, basic animation<br>
<br>

These lessons are intended to be taught sequentially.<br>

### Lesson 1
The first lesson involves students engaging in a series of unplugged exercises<br>
to get them familiar with the concept. The choice of this pedagogical approach<br>
was that I feel classes and objects can be somewhat of an abstract concept within<br>
a coding context. I feel that being presented with some real world, physical analogies<br>
would be helpful for students to understand this concept prior to trying to programming it.<br>

### Lesson 2

The second lesson involves students creating attributes and methods for a Ball class.<br>
In this lesson, there are several different pedagogical approaches. First, students are provided<br>
with codes stems, specifically the basic template for creating a class and guiding comments<br>
to help them organize their code. I chose to do this because the main concept I want to cover<br>
in this lesson is having them create instance variables and methods.<br>
Students are asked to comment in their own subgoals. I chose to do this both as a way to demonstrate<br> understanding of what they need to do in their code and also to build the<br>
skill of labeling subgoals as a general coding practice.<br>
At a certain point, students are also asked to write pseudo code and draw the outcome which<br>
they predict will happen based on their pseudocode<br>
