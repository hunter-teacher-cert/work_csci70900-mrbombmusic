to start:
break class into groups of 4
Each group will make a musical pattern using 4 sounds (snap, clap, pat, stomp)
each group comes up with a pattern using each sound one time.

Example:
clap, pat, snap, stomp

Have each group perform their pattern.
Then have class perform do that group's pattern.

Keep running list of each groups pattern on the board.
Indicate each beat.

          bt 1  bt 2  bt 3  bt 4
pattern 1: snap, pat, clap, stomp

pattern 2: snap, stomp, clap, pat

pattern 3: stomp, clap, snap, pat

pattern 4: pat, clap, stomp, snap

Method for accountability/engagement:
Have each group then choose a different pattern to perform.
Write down pattern on piece of paper (do not show)
Group performs pattern. rest of class has to guess which one.

Adding on:
Once all groups have gone, explain as a class we are going to
do four patterns in a row.

Write out each pattern # in order.
Then perform each pattern in a sequence.
Once one pattern is finished, go immediately to the next pattern.

Teacher provides two examples.
Choose students to provide examples.


Example
loop 4 times
pattern 1, 3, 2, 4
end loop

loop 4 times
pattern 2, 2, 3, 1
end loop

Show students how to make new patterns by referencing to the pattern and beat number.

example:
p1, bt 3 = clap
p4, bt 1 = snap
p3, bt 3 = snap
p2, bt 1 = snap

Make new 4 beat pattern by using this form of referencing sounds.
Teacher provides 1-2 examples of this.

Have each group create their own pattern using this form of referencing.

Possible extensions/competitions:

Each group creates pattern on piece of paper.
Teacher gives randomly chosen pattern to another group to figure out and perform.
Provide appropriate amount of time to prepare.
Each group goes to front of class to perform.
Group who made pattern checks for accuracy.
All students in group must perform correctly to receive credit/point.
