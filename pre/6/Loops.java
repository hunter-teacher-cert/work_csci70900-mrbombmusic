This method checks the results of myexp function and Math.myexp.
The exercise says to adjust the number of terms until the estimated value
agrees with the correct answer when x is 1. That is the number 17 in the myexp.
However, the exercise also said that the number of terms should be the second argument that check sends to myexp.
But it did not specify to make the check method with two arguments.

e^x = 1 + x + x^2 / 2! + x^3 / 3! + x^4 / 4! + â€¦
It was not clear what 'e' was in this exercise.

The instructions said
"You can make this method more efficient if you realize that
the numerator of each term is the same as its predecessor multiplied by x,
and the denominator is the same as its predecessor multiplied by i"
This is why I created the 2 previous variables, to store the values of
the predecessor that would then be multiplied by x and i respectively.
The argument n is the number of terms.
