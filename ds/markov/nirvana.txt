She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice, your advice
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of your Highness, I'm left back
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey!
Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice, your advice

I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
One baby to another says, I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew my meat for you
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you With eyes so dilated, I've became your pupil
You've taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow
I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful
Vacuum out the fluids
Chew my meat for you
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you
One baby to another says, I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
A travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew my meat for you
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
Sloppy lips to lips
You're my vitamins
I like you
Underneath the bridge
The tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from the ceiling
But it's okay to eat fish
'Cause they don't have any feelings Something in the way
I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally
I'm so tired I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
I'll start this off
Without any words
I got so high that
I scratched 'til I bled Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? The finest day
That I ever had
Was when I learned
To cry on command Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain My mother died
Every night
It's safe to say
Don't quote me on that Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? The black sheep got
Blackmailed again
Forgot to put
On the zip code Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say? It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don't make a sense Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? One more special
Message to go
And then I'm done
And I can go home Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? I'm on a plain
I can't complain
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yeah, hey I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yeah, hey, yeh And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, never mind Hello, how low
Hello, how low
Hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial What else should I be
All apologies
What else could I say
Everyone is gay
What else could I write
I don't have the right
What else should I be
All apologies In the sun
In the sun I feel as one
In the sun
In the sun
Married
Buried I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything's my fault
I take all the blame
Aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezer burn
Choking on the ashes of her enemy In the sun
In the sun I feel as one
In the sun
In the sun
Married
Buried
Teenage angst has paid off well
Now I'm bored and old
Self appointed judges judge
More than they have sold If she floats than she is not
A witch like we had thought
A down payment on another
One at Salem's lot Serve the servants oh no
That legendary divorce is such a bore As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead I had a dad I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
That I haven't thought before Serve the servants oh no
That legendary divorce is such a bore
most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice Go away get away, get away, get away
Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms
Leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume
I am my own parasite
I don't need a host to live
We feed off of each other
We can share our endorphins
Doll steak, test meat I won my own pet virus
I get to pet and name her
Her milk is my shit
My shit is her milk Doll steak, test meat
Look on the bright side is suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and or sleeping
Protector of the kennel
Ectoplasma
EctoSkeletal
Obituary birthday
Your scent is still here in my place of recovery
Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please don't go Grandma take me home Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatos and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good She said, well, don't you start your crying
Go outside and ride your bike
That's what I did, I killed my toe After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms Grandma take me home
It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear you're asking wherever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me, this is starting to sound the same
I miss the comfort in being sad
In her false witness, we hope you're still with us,
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient,
A display of patience, disease-covered Puget Sound
She'll come back as fire, to burn all the liars,
And leave a blanket of ash on the ground
I miss the comfort in being sad
And if you save yourself,
You will make him happy!
He'll keep you in a jar,
And you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breathing holes,
And you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you with grass,
And you'll think you're happy  now! You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh And if you cut yourself,
You will think you're happy!
He'll keep you in a jar,
Then you'll make him happy
He'll give you breathing holes,
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you with grass,
Then you'll think you're happy  now! You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh And if you fool yourself,
You will make him happy!
He'll keep you in a jar,
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breathing holes,
Then you will seem happy
You'll wallow in the shit,
Then you'll think you're happy now! You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh
Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands He's the one
Who like all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means
Don't know what it means
And I say
He's the one
Who like all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means

And I say yeah We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom He's the one
Who like all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means
Don't know what it means
And I say
He's the one
Who like all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means
Don't know what it means
And I say yeah I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun I think I'm dumb
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
My heart is broke
But I have some glue
Help me inhale
And mend it with you
We'll float around
And hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
And have a hangover, have a hangover Skin the sun
Fall asleep
Wish away
The soul is cheap
Lesson learned
Wish me luck
Soothe the burn
Wake me up I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun

Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an known enemy Take your time, hurry up
The choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old Memoria, memoria
Memoria, memoria Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old Memoria, memoria
Memoria, memoria And I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
