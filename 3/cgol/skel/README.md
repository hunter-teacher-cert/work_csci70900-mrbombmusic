# Class Work 7/1/21
# Conway's Game Of life

## Liam Baum, Jovani Cardenas, and Tiffany Wong

**The Rules of Life:**

**Survivals:**

- A cell with 2 or 3 living neighbours will survive for the next generation.<br>

**Death:**

- Each cell with >3 neighbours will die from overpopulation.
- Every cell with <2 neighbours will die from isolation.<br>

**Birth:**

- Each dead cell adjacent to exactly 3 living neighbours is a birth cell. It will come alive next generation.<br>

NOTA BENE:  All births and deaths occur simultaneously. Together, they constitute a single generation
