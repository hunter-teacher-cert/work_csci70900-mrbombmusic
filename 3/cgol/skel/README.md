*The Rules of Life:*

*Survivals:*
- A cell with 2 or 3 living neighbours will survive for the next generation.
*Death:*

- Each cell with >3 neighbours will die from overpopulation.
- Every cell with <2 neighbours will die from isolation.
*Birth:*

- Each dead cell adjacent to exactly 3 living neighbours is a birth cell. It will come alive next generation.
NOTA BENE:  All births and deaths occur simultaneously. Together, they constitute a single generation
